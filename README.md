# Overview

I created this project to stretch and prove my ability to code using the C# language. I have taken courses at BYUI that have taught and tested me. I just don't feel the same excitement to create projects in C# and that stems from not completely understanding its application. 

This project will be a game stemming from the Tower of Hanoi. I am adding this project to a guide that teaches datastructures in C#. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Code was running in Rider, but after renaming the folder dependencies were deleted causing the files not to run. Move back over to Rider, or figure out how to run in VS Code
- Seperate classes for better organization.
- Simplify visual by using "=" to represent block size.
